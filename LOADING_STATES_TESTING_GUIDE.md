# Loading States - Testing Guide

## Quick Start Testing Guide

This guide will help you test the loading state improvements on the event registration page.

---

## 🚀 Quick Test (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Interactive Demo Page

The easiest way to see the loading states in action:

1. **Start the development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Open the test page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3111/test-loading-states.html
   ```

3. **Click the test buttons**:
   - "Show Initial Loading State" - See the full-page loading indicator
   - "Show City Selection Loading" - See the overlay loading indicator
   - "Simulate Complete Flow" - See the entire flow from start to finish

**Expected Results:**
- Each button triggers a loading animation
- Loading states automatically disappear after a few seconds
- Success messages appear when loading completes

## 🔍 Detailed Testing (15 minutes)

### Test 1: Initial Page Load

**Objective:** Verify the full-page loading state appears while cities are being fetched.

**Steps:**
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Set throttling to "Slow 3G" (to slow down the API)
4. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3111/register-event`
5. Observe the page as it loads

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Full-page loading indicator appears immediately
- ✅ Shows "Loading Event Registration" heading
- ✅ Shows "Please wait while we prepare the registration form..." message
- ✅ Animated spinner with dual animation (spin + ping)
- ✅ Loading state disappears when cities are loaded
- ✅ Form becomes visible and interactive

**If API Fails (CORS error):**
- ✅ Loading state disappears
- ✅ Error message appears: "Failed to load cities. Please try again."
- ✅ Form is still visible but city dropdown shows error

**Screenshot Locations:**
- Initial loading state: Full page with spinner
- After loading: Form with city dropdown populated

---

### Test 2: City Selection Loading

**Objective:** Verify the overlay loading state appears when a city is selected.

**Prerequisites:**
- Cities must be loaded successfully (or use mock data)
- Page must be on step 1 of registration

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3111/register-event`
2. Wait for cities to load
3. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) → Network tab
4. Set throttling to "Slow 3G"
5. Click on the city dropdown
6. Select any city (e.g., "Hyderabad")
7. Observe the loading behavior

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Overlay appears immediately over the city selection section
- ✅ Shows "Loading events for [City Name]..." message
- ✅ Shows "Please wait" subtext
- ✅ Animated spinner (smaller than initial load)
- ✅ Background content is blurred
- ✅ City dropdown is disabled during loading
- ✅ Overlay disappears when events are loaded
- ✅ Event dropdown becomes available

**If API Fails:**
- ✅ Overlay disappears
- ✅ Error message appears: "Failed to load events. Please try again."
- ✅ City dropdown remains enabled for retry

**Screenshot Locations:**
- Before selection: City dropdown visible
- During loading: Overlay covering city section
- After loading: Event dropdown visible

### Test 3: Error Handling

**Objective:** Verify error states are handled gracefully.

**Test 3.1: Cities API Failure**

**Steps:**
1. Disconnect from internet or block the API endpoint
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3111/register-event`
3. Observe the behavior

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Loading state appears briefly
- ✅ Loading state disappears when error occurs
- ✅ Error message appears: "Failed to load cities. Please try again."
- ✅ Form is still visible
- ✅ No infinite loading state

**Test 3.2: Events API Failure**

**Steps:**
1. Load the page successfully (cities loaded)
2. Disconnect from internet or block the API endpoint
3. Select a city
4. Observe the behavior

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Loading overlay appears
- ✅ Loading overlay disappears when error occurs
- ✅ Error message appears: "Failed to load events. Please try again."
- ✅ City dropdown remains enabled
- ✅ User can try selecting a different city

---

### Test 4: User Interaction During Loading

**Objective:** Verify users cannot trigger duplicate requests during loading.

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3111/register-event`
2. Set network throttling to "Slow 3G"
3. Select a city
4. While loading overlay is visible, try to:
   - Click the city dropdown again
   - Select a different city
   - Click other form elements

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ City dropdown is disabled during loading
- ✅ Cannot select a different city while loading
- ✅ Other form elements remain interactive
- ✅ Only one API request is made per city selection

---

### Test 5: Visual Design

**Objective:** Verify the loading states match the design system.

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Colors match the theme (primary blue)
- ✅ Animations are smooth (no jank)
- ✅ Spinner size is appropriate
  - Initial load: Large (16x16)
  - City selection: Medium (12x12)
- ✅ Text is readable and clear
- ✅ Backdrop blur effect works
- ✅ Dark mode support works correctly
- ✅ Responsive on mobile devices

**Test in Different Themes:**
1. Light mode: Default appearance
2. Dark mode: Click theme toggle button
   - ✅ Background colors adapt
   - ✅ Text remains readable
   - ✅ Spinner color adjusts

---

### Test 6: Responsive Design

**Objective:** Verify loading states work on different screen sizes.

**Steps:**
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Click "Toggle device toolbar" (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Test on different devices:
   - Mobile (375px width)
   - Tablet (768px width)
   - Desktop (1920px width)

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Loading states are centered on all screen sizes
- ✅ Text is readable on small screens
- ✅ Spinner size is appropriate
- ✅ Overlay covers entire section on all sizes
- ✅ No horizontal scrolling
- ✅ Touch interactions work on mobile

## 🐛 Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Loading state never appears
**Possible Causes:**
- API responds too quickly (< 100ms)
- State variables not being set correctly

**Solution:**
- Use network throttling to slow down API
- Check console for state changes
- Verify `setIsLoadingCities(true)` is called before API

### Issue 2: Loading state never disappears
**Possible Causes:**
- API call failed without error handling
- `finally` block not executing

**Solution:**
- Check console for errors
- Verify `finally` block sets loading state to false
- Check network tab for API response

### Issue 3: Overlay doesn't cover content
**Possible Causes:**
- Parent container missing `relative` class
- Z-index too low

**Solution:**
- Add `relative` class to parent container
- Verify overlay has `z-10` class
- Check for conflicting CSS

### Issue 4: Multiple API calls triggered
**Possible Causes:**
- Dropdown not disabled during loading
- User clicking multiple times

**Solution:**
- Verify dropdown has `disabled={cities.length === 0 || isLoadingEvents}`
- Check that loading state is set before API call

### Issue 5: CORS errors
**Possible Causes:**
- API doesn't allow localhost origin
- Backend CORS configuration

**Solution:**
- This is expected in local development
- Loading states will still work correctly
- Error messages will appear after loading
- Test with production API or mock data
