# Partners API Test Report

## üî¥ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** ‚ùå API ENDPOINTS NOT WORKING

---

## üìã Executive Summary

All Partner API endpoints are **NOT REGISTERED** in n8n. This means the n8n workflows have not been created or are not active.

**Test Results:**
- ‚úÖ Passed: 6/8 tests (75%) - Only tests that expected errors
- ‚ùå Failed: 2/8 tests (25%) - Core functionality tests
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Skipped: 5 tests - Due to missing workflow

**Average Response Time:** 79.88ms (Server is responding, but workflows missing)

---

## ‚ùå Issues Found

### 1. **All Partner API Webhooks Not Registered**

Every endpoint returns a 404 error:
```
"The requested webhook \"POST v1/nibog/partners/create\" is not registered."
```

**Affected Endpoints:**
- ‚ùå `POST /v1/nibog/partners/create` - Not registered
- ‚ùå `GET /v1/nibog/partners` - Not registered
- ‚ùå `GET /v1/nibog/partners/:id` - Not registered
- ‚ùå `PUT /v1/nibog/partners/update` - Not registered
- ‚ùå `DELETE /v1/nibog/partners/:id` - Not registered

### 2. **Root Cause**

The n8n hint message tells us:
> "The workflow must be active for a production URL to run successfully. You can activate the workflow using the toggle in the top-right of the editor."

**Possible Reasons:**
1. ‚úó Partner CRUD workflows were never created in n8n
2. ‚úó Partner CRUD workflows exist but are NOT ACTIVATED
3. ‚úó Webhook paths are configured differently than documented
4. ‚úó n8n server is not running properly

---

## üîß Required Actions

### Action 1: Check n8n Workflow Status
1. Log in to your n8n instance at `https://ai.alviongs.com`
2. Look for workflows named:
   - "Partners Create"
   - "Partners Get All"
   - "Partners Get By ID"
   - "Partners Update"
   - "Partners Delete"
3. Check if these workflows exist

### Action 2: Activate Workflows (If They Exist)
If the workflows exist but are inactive:
1. Open each workflow in n8n editor
2. Click the **toggle switch** in the top-right corner
3. Ensure it shows **"Active"** (green)

### Action 3: Create Workflows (If They Don't Exist)
If the workflows don't exist, you need to create them. Each workflow should have:

#### **Workflow 1: Partners - Create**
- **Webhook Node:** POST `/v1/nibog/partners/create`
- **PostgreSQL Node:** INSERT query
- **Respond to Webhook Node:** Return created partner data

#### **Workflow 2: Partners - Get All**
- **Webhook Node:** GET `/v1/nibog/partners`
- **PostgreSQL Node:** SELECT query (WHERE status = 'Active', ORDER BY display_priority)
- **Respond to Webhook Node:** Return array of partners

#### **Workflow 3: Partners - Get By ID**
- **Webhook Node:** GET `/v1/nibog/partners/:id`
- **PostgreSQL Node:** SELECT query (WHERE id = {{$parameter["id"]}})
- **Respond to Webhook Node:** Return single partner

#### **Workflow 4: Partners - Update**
- **Webhook Node:** PUT `/v1/nibog/partners/update`
- **PostgreSQL Node:** UPDATE query
- **Respond to Webhook Node:** Return updated partner data

#### **Workflow 5: Partners - Delete**
- **Webhook Node:** DELETE `/v1/nibog/partners/:id`
- **PostgreSQL Node:** DELETE query
- **Respond to Webhook Node:** Return deleted partner data

### Action 4: Verify Database Table
Ensure the `partners` table exists in PostgreSQL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partners (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  partner_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  display_priority INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL
);
```

| Create Valid Partner | POST /partners/create | 200 OK with data | 404 Not Found | ‚ùå FAILED |
| Get All Partners | GET /partners | 200 OK with array | 404 Not Found | ‚ùå FAILED |

### Tests That Passed (Expected Errors)
| Test | Endpoint | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Create with Missing Fields | POST /partners/create | Error | 404 Not Found | ‚úÖ PASSED |
| Create with Invalid Status | POST /partners/create | Error | 404 Not Found | ‚úÖ PASSED |
| Get Non-existent Partner | GET /partners/999999 | Error | 404 Not Found | ‚úÖ PASSED |
| Update Non-existent | PUT /partners/update | Error | 404 Not Found | ‚úÖ PASSED |
| Update without ID | PUT /partners/update | Error | 404 Not Found | ‚úÖ PASSED |
| Delete Non-existent | DELETE /partners/999999 | Error | 404 Not Found | ‚úÖ PASSED |

### Tests That Were Skipped
| Test | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Get Partner by ID | No partner ID available (create failed) |

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Check n8n workflows
   - Are they created? ‚Üí If NO, create them
   - Are they active? ‚Üí If NO, activate them

2. **VERIFY:** Database connection
   - Can n8n connect to PostgreSQL?
   - Does the `partners` table exist?

3. **TEST:** After fixing, run the test again:
   ```bash
   node test-partners-api-v2.js
   ```

4. **EXPECTED:** After fixing, you should see:
   - ‚úÖ Create Valid Partner: PASSED
   - ‚úÖ Get All Partners: PASSED
   - Partner data in responses with IDs

---

## üìù Documentation Update Required

Your `partners.md` documentation shows:
```
http://localhost:5678/webhook/partners/create
```

But it should be:
```
https://ai.alviongs.com/webhook/v1/nibog/partners/create
```

Update the documentation once workflows are working.

---

## üÜò Support

If you need help creating the n8n workflows:
1. Share access to your n8n instance, OR
2. Export existing working workflows (like events, games) and modify them for partners

**The structure should be identical to your existing NIBOG API workflows.**

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

You'll know the API is working when:
- ‚úÖ All 13 tests pass (not just expected errors)
- ‚úÖ Create partner returns partner data with ID
- ‚úÖ Get all partners returns array of partners
- ‚úÖ Update/Delete operations work on created partners
- ‚úÖ Response time remains under 500ms

---

**Current Status:** üî¥ NOT WORKING - Workflows need to be created/activated in n8n
