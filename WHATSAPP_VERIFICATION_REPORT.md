### ❌ **Critical Issues Identified:**
1. **WhatsApp notifications were DISABLED** in `.env` file

3. **Test file used hardcoded data** instead of real customer format

### ✅ **Fixes Applied:**

- Added WhatsApp notification sending immediately after successful booking creation
- Uses real customer data from booking process
- Includes proper error handling without failing the payment process

#### 3. **Fixed Hardcoded URLs for Production**
- **CRITICAL:** Removed hardcoded `http://localhost:3000` URLs
- Updated `verify-whatsapp-payment-flow.js` to use dynamic URL detection
- Fixed email sending in `app/api/payments/phonepe-status/route.ts` to use `getAppUrl()`
- Now works correctly in both development and production environments

#### 4. **Updated Test Data Format**
- Modified `test-booking-api.js` to use realistic customer data
- Changed from generic "Test Parent" to "Rajesh Kumar"
- Updated event details to match actual NIBOG events

## 🔄 **WhatsApp Notification Flow**

### **Primary Flow (Server-Side):**

2. PhonePe calls payment status API
3. Server creates booking and payment records
4. **Server sends WhatsApp notification immediately** ✅ NEW
5. Server sends email confirmation
6. Customer receives WhatsApp message with booking details

### **Backup Flow (Client-Side):**
1. If server-side WhatsApp fails or is delayed
2. Client-side payment callback page sends backup WhatsApp notification
3. Ensures customer always receives notification

## 📋 **WhatsApp Message Content**

### **Template Message (if enabled):**
- Uses `booking_confirmation_latest` template
- Includes: Customer name, event title, date, venue, child name, booking ref, amount, payment method

### **Text Message (fallback):**
```

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **1. Run Comprehensive Verification:**
```bash
node verify-whatsapp-payment-flow.js
```

### **2. Test Individual Components:**
```bash
# Test WhatsApp service only
node test-booking-api.js

# Check WhatsApp health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/whatsapp/health
```

### **3. Monitor Server Logs:**
- Look for `📱 STARTING WHATSAPP PROCESS` messages
- Check for `📱 WhatsApp notification sent successfully from server!`
- Monitor for any WhatsApp errors

## 🔧 **Configuration Verification**

### **Environment Variables (.env):**
```env
WHATSAPP_NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED=true  ✅ NOW ENABLED
ZAPTRA_API_URL=https://demo.zaptra.in/api/wpbox
ZAPTRA_API_TOKEN=QqfIcXJtovwgUSGMtX1a3PY0XbXQCETeqFMlfjYi5c0aa036
WHATSAPP_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true
WHATSAPP_RETRY_ATTEMPTS=3
WHATSAPP_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
WHATSAPP_DEBUG=false
WHATSAPP_USE_TEMPLATES=false

# URL Configuration (IMPORTANT for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://www.nibog.in  ✅ PRODUCTION URL
```

### **🌐 URL Configuration Details:**

#### **Dynamic URL Resolution:**
The system now uses smart URL detection that works in all environments:

1. **Development:** `http://localhost:3000` (or current port)
2. **Vercel Deployment:** Uses `VERCEL_URL` environment variable
3. **Production:** Uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` from environment
4. **Fallback:** `https://www.nibog.in`

#### **Files Using Dynamic URLs:**
- ✅ `app/api/payments/phonepe-status/route.ts` - Uses `getAppUrl()` for email sending
- ✅ `verify-whatsapp-payment-flow.js` - Dynamic base URL detection
- ✅ `services/ticketEmailService.ts` - Multiple URL fallbacks
- ✅ `config/phonepe.ts` - Smart environment detection

#### **No More Hardcoded URLs:**
- ❌ Removed: `http://localhost:3000` from server-side code
- ❌ Removed: Hardcoded localhost in email services
- ✅ Added: Dynamic URL resolution for all environments
