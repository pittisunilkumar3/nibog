# Partners API - Updated Test Results & Fix Required

## üéØ Current Status: PARTIALLY WORKING ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Test Results:** Endpoints are accessible but not functioning correctly

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

1. ‚úÖ **GET `/partners`** - Endpoint is accessible and returns empty array `[]`
2. ‚úÖ **POST `/partners/create`** - Endpoint accepts requests (returns 200 OK)
3. ‚úÖ Workflows are **ACTIVATED** in n8n
4. ‚úÖ Correct webhook paths: `https://ai.alviongs.com/webhook/partners/*`

---

## ‚ùå What's NOT Working

### Issue 1: Workflow Returns Acknowledgment Instead of Data
**Problem:**  
When creating a partner, the API returns:
```json
{
  "message": "Workflow was started"
}
```

**Expected:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "partner_name": "Test Partner Company",
  "image_url": "https://example.com/test-logo.png",
  "display_priority": 1,
  "status": "Active",
  "created_at": "2025-10-14T12:00:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": null
}
```

### Issue 2: Partners Not Being Saved to Database
**Problem:**  
After creating a partner, GET request still returns empty array `[]`

**This means:**  
- Either the PostgreSQL INSERT is not being executed
- Or the database table doesn't exist
- Or there's an error in the workflow that's being silently ignored

---

## üîß Required Fixes in n8n

### Fix 1: Configure "Respond to Webhook" Node

In your Partners CREATE workflow:

1. **Open the workflow** in n8n
2. **Find the Webhook node**
   - Click on it
   - In settings, find "Response Mode"
   - Change to: **"Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node"**
   - Save the node

3. **Find or Add "Respond to Webhook" node**
   - It should be the LAST node in your workflow
   - Connect it to the PostgreSQL node output

4. **Configure the "Respond to Webhook" node:**
   ```
   Response Code: 200
   Response Body: {{ $json }}
   ```
   - This will return the actual PostgreSQL result (the created partner data)

### Fix 2: Ensure PostgreSQL INSERT is Executed

In your PostgreSQL node:

1. **Verify the INSERT query:**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO partners (partner_name, image_url, display_priority, status, created_at)
   VALUES (
     '{{ $json.body.partner_name }}',
     '{{ $json.body.image_url }}',
     {{ $json.body.display_priority }},
     '{{ $json.body.status }}',
     CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
   )
   RETURNING *;
   ```
   
   **Important:** Must have `RETURNING *;` to get the created data back

2. **Check the data path:**
   - If webhook body is parsed, use: `$json.body.partner_name`
   - If not, use: `$json.partner_name`
   - Check by testing the workflow and inspecting the webhook node output

### Fix 3: Verify Database Table Exists

Run this SQL in your PostgreSQL database:

```sql
-- Check if table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
  SELECT FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_name = 'partners'
);

-- If it doesn't exist, create it:
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partners (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  partner_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  display_priority INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Active' CHECK (status IN ('Active', 'Inactive')),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL
);

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_partners_status ON partners(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_partners_priority ON partners(display_priority);
```

## üîç How to Debug in n8n

1. **Go to your n8n instance**
2. **Open the Partners Create workflow**
3. **Click "Execute Workflow" button** (test mode)
4. **Use Postman or curl to send a test request:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://ai.alviongs.com/webhook/partners/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "partner_name": "Debug Test",
       "image_url": "https://example.com/debug.png",
       "display_priority": 1,
       "status": "Active"
     }'
   ```
5. **Check each node's output** in n8n:
   - Webhook node: Should show the received data
   - PostgreSQL node: Should show the inserted row
   - Respond to Webhook node: Should show what's being returned

6. **Look for red error indicators** on any nodes

---

## üìã Workflow Structure Should Look Like This

```
[Webhook Trigger (POST /partners/create)]
           ‚Üì
[Code Node - Validation] (Optional)
           ‚Üì
[PostgreSQL - INSERT with RETURNING *]
           ‚Üì
[Respond to Webhook - Return $json]
```

**Critical Settings:**
- Webhook: Response Mode = "Using 'Respond to Webhook' Node"
- PostgreSQL: Must use `RETURNING *;` in INSERT query
- Respond to Webhook: Response Body = `{{ $json }}`

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After fixing, you should get this response when creating a partner:

```bash
POST https://ai.alviongs.com/webhook/partners/create
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "partner_name": "Test Partner Company",
  "image_url": "https://example.com/test-logo.png",
  "display_priority": 1,
  "status": "Active",
  "created_at": "2025-10-14T12:30:00.000Z",
  "updated_at": null
}
```

And then GET should return:
```bash
GET https://ai.alviongs.com/webhook/partners
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "partner_name": "Test Partner Company",
    "image_url": "https://example.com/test-logo.png",
    "display_priority": 1,
    "status": "Active",
    "created_at": "2025-10-14T12:30:00.000Z",
    "updated_at": null
  }
]
```

## üß™ How to Test After Fixing

Run this command:
```bash
node test-partners-api-final.js
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All tests should PASS
- ‚úÖ Created partner should have an ID
- ‚úÖ GET request should return the created partner
- ‚úÖ Update and Delete tests should run (not skip)

---

## üìû Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Fix the "Respond to Webhook" node configuration
2. **VERIFY:** Check if PostgreSQL INSERT is being executed
3. **CONFIRM:** Database table exists with correct schema
4. **TEST:** Run `node test-partners-api-final.js` again
5. **SUCCESS:** Once working, update `partners.md` documentation with correct paths

## üéØ Current vs Expected

| Endpoint | Current Response | Expected Response |
|----------|------------------|-------------------|
| GET /partners | `[]` (empty) | Array of partners |
| POST /partners/create | `{"message": "Workflow was started"}` | Partner object with ID |
| GET /partners/:id | Not tested (no IDs) | Single partner object |
| PUT /partners/update | Not tested | Updated partner object |
| DELETE /partners/:id | Not tested | Deleted partner object |

**Priority:** üî¥ HIGH - Frontend is waiting for this API

**Estimated Fix Time:** 5-10 minutes (just configuration changes in n8n)
