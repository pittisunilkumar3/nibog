# Partners API Testing - Final Report

## 🎯 Summary

I have tested all your Partners API endpoints and found that **the n8n workflows are not registered/activated**.

---

## ❌ Test Results

**Status:** 🔴 **FAILED - API Not Working**

### What Was Tested
- ✅ POST `/v1/nibog/partners/create` - Create new partner
- ✅ GET `/v1/nibog/partners` - Get all active partners
- ✅ GET `/v1/nibog/partners/:id` - Get partner by ID
- ✅ PUT `/v1/nibog/partners/update` - Update partner
- ✅ DELETE `/v1/nibog/partners/:id` - Delete partner

### Results
- **All endpoints returned:** `404 Not Found`
- **Error message:** "The requested webhook is not registered"
- **Root cause:** n8n workflows are either:
  1. Not created, OR
  2. Not activated

## 🔧 What Needs to Be Done

### Step 1: Access n8n
Go to your n8n instance: `https://ai.alviongs.com`

### Step 2: Check for Workflows
Look for these workflows:
- Partners - Create
- Partners - Get All
- Partners - Get By ID
- Partners - Update
- Partners - Delete

### Step 3: If Workflows Don't Exist
**Option A:** Create them manually using the guide in `N8N_PARTNERS_WORKFLOWS_GUIDE.md`

**Option B:** Copy/duplicate your existing NIBOG workflows (Events, Games, etc.) and modify for Partners

### Step 4: If Workflows Exist But Inactive
1. Open each workflow
2. Click the toggle switch (top-right corner)
3. Ensure it shows "Active" in green

### Step 5: Verify Database
Run this SQL to check the partners table:
```sql
SELECT * FROM partners LIMIT 5;
```

If table doesn't exist, create it:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS partners (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  partner_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  image_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  display_priority INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Active',
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NULL
);
```

### Immediate (YOU need to do this):
1. 🔴 **Log in to n8n** at https://ai.alviongs.com
2. 🔴 **Check if Partner workflows exist**
3. 🔴 **If they exist:** Activate them (toggle switch)
4. 🔴 **If they don't exist:** Create them using the guide

## 💡 Important Notes

1. **The server is working fine** - Response times are good (~80ms)
2. **Only the workflows are missing** - This is a configuration issue
3. **Your other APIs work** - So you know how to set this up
4. **Follow the same pattern** - Use your Events/Games workflows as templates

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

If you're stuck:
1. Share screenshot of your n8n workflows list
2. Share the Partners table schema from PostgreSQL
3. Or share access to n8n instance for direct help

---

**Current Status:** 🔴 BLOCKED - Waiting for n8n workflows to be created/activated

**Estimated Fix Time:** 15-30 minutes (if you copy existing workflows)

**Priority:** HIGH (Frontend Partners section is waiting for this API)
