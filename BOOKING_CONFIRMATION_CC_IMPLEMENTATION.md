# Booking Confirmation CC Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of CC functionality for booking confirmation emails, ensuring that `newindababyolympics@gmail.com` receives a copy of every booking confirmation email sent to customers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Email API (`app/api/send-receipt-email/route.ts`)
- **Added CC parameter support**: Modified the API to accept an optional `cc` parameter
- **Updated mail options**: Added conditional CC field to nodemailer configuration
- **Backward compatibility**: CC is optional, so existing functionality remains intact

```typescript
// Before
const { to, subject, html, settings } = await request.json()

// After  
const { to, subject, html, settings, cc } = await request.json()

// Mail options now include CC when provided
const mailOptions = {
  from: `"${settings.sender_name}" <${settings.sender_email}>`,
  to: to,
  subject: subject,
  html: html,
  attachments: [],
  ...(cc && { cc: cc }) // Add CC if provided
}
```

### 2. Updated PhonePe Status Route (`app/api/payments/phonepe-status/route.ts`)
- **Added CC to both booking confirmation email calls**
- **Ensures newindababyolympics@gmail.com receives copies of all successful payment confirmations**

### 3. Updated PhonePe Callback Route (`app/api/payments/phonepe-callback/route.ts`)
- **Added CC to both booking confirmation email calls**
- **Covers both regular bookings and pending booking confirmations**

### 4. Updated Email Notification Service (`services/emailNotificationService.ts`)
- **Updated `sendBookingConfirmationFromServer` function**
- **Updated `sendBookingConfirmationFromClient` function**
- **Updated reminder email function for consistency**

## Email Recipients

### Primary Recipients (TO field)
- Customer's email address from booking data
- Fallback to generated email if customer email is not available

### CC Recipients
- `newindababyolympics@gmail.com` - for monitoring and customer service purposes

## Testing

### Automated Test
A test script has been created: `test-booking-confirmation-cc.js`

To run the test:
```bash
node test-booking-confirmation-cc.js
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Complete a test booking**:
   - Go through the booking flow
   - Complete payment via PhonePe
   - Check both email addresses receive confirmation

3. **Verify email delivery**:
   - Customer email should receive the booking confirmation
   - `newindababyolympics@gmail.com` should receive the same email as CC

### Test Scenarios Covered

1. **PhonePe Status Route**: Payment completion via status check
2. **PhonePe Callback Route**: Payment completion via callback
3. **Email Notification Service**: Direct email sending functions
4. **Reminder Emails**: Event reminders and payment pending notifications

## Email Flow Diagram

```

Booking confirmation triggered
         ↓
Email sent with:
├── TO: customer@email.com
└── CC: newindababyolympics@gmail.com
```

## Benefits

1. **Customer Service**: newindababyolympics@gmail.com can monitor all bookings
2. **Backup**: Ensures booking confirmations are tracked even if customer email fails
3. **Transparency**: Admin team is automatically notified of all successful bookings
4. **Non-intrusive**: Customers don't see the CC recipient
5. **Consistent**: All booking confirmation emails include the CC

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing email functionality remains unchanged
- CC parameter is optional in the API
- If CC is not provided, emails work as before
- No breaking changes to existing integrations

## Security Considerations

- CC recipient is hardcoded to prevent abuse
- Customer email addresses are not exposed to CC recipient
- Email settings remain secure and unchanged

## Monitoring

To monitor the implementation:

1. **Check email logs** in the server console
2. **Verify both recipients** receive emails
3. **Monitor email delivery rates** for any issues
4. **Check spam folders** initially to ensure delivery

## Troubleshooting

### If CC emails are not received:

1. **Check SMTP settings**: Ensure the email service supports CC
2. **Verify email address**: Confirm newindababyolympics@gmail.com is correct
3. **Check spam filters**: CC emails might be filtered
4. **Review server logs**: Look for email sending errors
5. **Test with different email providers**: Some providers have CC restrictions

### Common Issues:

- **SMTP limitations**: Some email services limit CC functionality
- **Rate limiting**: High volume might trigger rate limits
- **Authentication**: Ensure SMTP credentials allow CC sending

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multiple CC recipients**: Support array of CC addresses
2. **BCC support**: Add blind carbon copy functionality
3. **Email templates**: Separate templates for admin notifications
4. **Email preferences**: Allow customers to opt-in for admin notifications
5. **Analytics**: Track email delivery success rates

## Conclusion

The implementation successfully adds CC functionality to all booking confirmation emails while maintaining backward compatibility and ensuring reliable delivery to both customers and the admin team at newindababyolympics@gmail.com.
