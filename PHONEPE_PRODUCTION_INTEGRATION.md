# PhonePe Production Integration for NIBOG Event Registration

## üéØ Integration Summary

PhonePe payment gateway has been successfully integrated into your event registration page at `http://localhost:3000/register-event` with **production URLs and credentials**.

## üîß Configuration Details

### Environment Setup
- **Environment**: Production
- **Domain**: https://nibog.in
- **Merchant ID**: M11BWXEAW0AJ
- **API URLs**: Production PhonePe endpoints

### Files Modified/Created

1. **Configuration Files**:
   - `config/phonepe.ts` - Updated with production environment support
   - `.env.local` - Created with production credentials

2. **API Routes**:
   - `app/api/payments/phonepe-initiate/route.ts` - Enhanced logging
   - `app/api/payments/phonepe-status/route.ts` - Enhanced logging  
   - `app/api/payments/phonepe-callback/route.ts` - Enhanced logging

3. **Services**:
   - `services/paymentService.ts` - Updated with validation and production URLs

4. **Test Endpoint**:
   - `app/api/test-phonepe/route.ts` - Configuration testing endpoint

## üöÄ How It Works

### Payment Flow
1. User fills registration form on `/register-event`
2. User proceeds to payment step
3. PhonePe payment is initiated with production credentials
4. User is redirected to PhonePe payment page
5. After payment, user returns to `/payment-callback`
6. Payment status is verified and booking is updated

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Production PhonePe URLs
- ‚úÖ Secure credential management
- ‚úÖ Proper callback handling
- ‚úÖ Payment status verification
- ‚úÖ Booking status updates
- ‚úÖ Error handling and logging

## üß™ Testing the Integration

### 1. Test Configuration (Development Only)
```bash
# Visit this URL to test configuration
http://localhost:3000/api/test-phonepe
```

### 2. Test Payment Flow
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/register-event`
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Proceed through the steps to payment
4. Complete a test payment (‚Çπ1 recommended for first test)

### 3. Monitor Logs
Check browser console and server logs for:
- Configuration validation
- Payment initiation
- Callback processing
- Error messages

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Production Environment
- **Real Money**: This uses production PhonePe - real transactions will occur
- **Domain Whitelisting**: Ensure https://nibog.in is whitelisted in PhonePe merchant dashboard
- **SSL Required**: Production PhonePe requires HTTPS

### Security Considerations
- Credentials are stored in `.env.local` (not committed to git)
- Sensitive data is masked in logs
- Test endpoint only works in development mode

## üîÑ Environment Variables

The following environment variables are configured in `.env.local`:

```env
PHONEPE_ENVIRONMENT=production
PHONEPE_PROD_MERCHANT_ID=M11BWXEAW0AJ
PHONEPE_PROD_SALT_KEY=63542457-2eb4-4ed4-83f2-da9eaed9fcca
PHONEPE_PROD_SALT_INDEX=2
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://nibog.in
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid Merchant ID"**
- Verify production credentials are correct
- Check environment is set to 'production'

**"Checksum Mismatch"**
- Verify salt key and index are correct
- Check for any extra spaces in environment variables

**"Redirect URL Not Whitelisted"**
- Add https://nibog.in to PhonePe merchant dashboard
- Ensure callback URLs match exactly

### Debug Steps
1. Check configuration: `http://localhost:3000/api/test-phonepe`
2. Review browser console for errors
3. Check server logs for payment flow
4. Verify environment variables are loaded correctly

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the configuration test endpoint
2. Review the logs for specific error messages
3. Verify PhonePe merchant dashboard settings
4. Ensure domain is properly whitelisted

## üéâ Ready to Go!

Your PhonePe integration is now configured for production use with:
- Production credentials from the phonepay folder
- Your domain (https://nibog.in)
- Proper error handling and logging
- Secure callback processing

**Next Steps:**
1. Test with a small amount (‚Çπ1) first
2. Monitor the payment flow end-to-end
3. Verify booking confirmations are working
4. Deploy to production when ready
