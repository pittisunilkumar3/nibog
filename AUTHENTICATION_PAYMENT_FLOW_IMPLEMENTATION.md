# Authentication and Payment Flow Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented the authentication and payment flow for the event registration page as requested. The implementation provides a seamless user experience with proper authentication checks, state management, and PhonePe payment integration.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Authentication Flow**
- **Smart Authentication Check**: The system now checks authentication status at multiple points in the registration flow
- **Progress Preservation**: All registration data (including add-ons) is saved to sessionStorage when redirecting to login
- **Seamless Return**: After login, users are redirected back to the exact step they were on
- **Clear User Feedback**: Visual indicators show authentication status and requirements

### 2. **Improved Payment Integration**
- **PhonePe Integration**: Fully functional PhonePe payment gateway integration
- **Secure Payment Flow**: Authentication is required before payment processing
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Payment Status Tracking**: Real-time payment status updates and callbacks

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Step Indicator**: Visual progress indicator showing current step (Registration → Add-ons → Payment)
- **Authentication Status**: Clear indicators showing login status and requirements
- **Smart Button Text**: Buttons dynamically show appropriate text based on authentication status
- **Progress Preservation**: Complete state restoration after login redirect

### 4. **State Management Improvements**
- **Complete Data Preservation**: All form data, add-ons, and step information saved
- **URL Parameter Handling**: Support for direct links to specific steps
- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of saved data after successful payment

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Check Points

1. **Step 1 → Step 2 (Add-ons)**:
   - If not authenticated: Saves data and redirects to login
   - If authenticated: Proceeds to add-ons step

2. **Step 2 → Step 3 (Payment)**:
   - If not authenticated: Saves data and redirects to login with payment step
   - If authenticated: Proceeds to payment step

3. **Payment Processing**:
   - Requires authentication
   - Creates booking and initiates PhonePe payment
   - Handles authentication errors gracefully

### Data Preservation

The system saves the following data to sessionStorage:
```javascript
{
  parentName, email, phone, childName, schoolName,
  dob, gender, eventDate, selectedCity, selectedEventType,
  selectedEvent, selectedGame, childAgeMonths,
  availableDates, step, termsAccepted
}
```

Add-ons are saved separately:
```javascript
[{
  addOnId, quantity, variantId
}]
```

### URL Parameters

- `?step=payment`: Direct link to payment step (requires saved data)
- `?step=addons`: Direct link to add-ons step (requires saved data)
- `?city=CityName`: Pre-select a city

## User Flow Examples

### Scenario 1: Non-authenticated User
1. User fills registration form
2. Clicks "Continue (Login Required)"
3. Redirected to login with return URL
4. After login, returns to add-ons step with all data restored
5. Proceeds to payment step
6. Completes PhonePe payment

### Scenario 2: Authenticated User
1. User fills registration form
2. Clicks "Continue to Add-ons"
3. Selects add-ons
4. Clicks "Proceed to Payment"
5. Completes PhonePe payment

### Scenario 3: Partial Completion
1. User starts registration, gets redirected to login
2. User closes browser/tab
3. User returns later and logs in
4. User visits `/register-event?step=payment`
5. System restores saved data and shows payment step

## Technical Components

### Modified Functions

1. **`handleRegistration()`**: Now focuses on authentication check and navigation
2. **`handleProceedToPayment()`**: New function for payment step authentication
3. **`handleContinueToPayment()`**: Updated to use authentication check
4. **`handlePayment()`**: Enhanced error handling and session cleanup
5. **State restoration logic**: Improved to handle step parameters and authentication

### New UI Components

1. **Authentication Status Indicator**: Shows login requirement or welcome message
2. **Step Indicator**: Visual progress through registration steps
3. **Smart Button Text**: Dynamic button labels based on authentication status

## Error Handling

- **Authentication Errors**: Automatic redirect to login with preserved state
- **Payment Errors**: User-friendly error messages with specific guidance
- **Network Errors**: Graceful handling with retry options
- **Session Expiry**: Automatic re-authentication flow

## Security Considerations

- **Session Validation**: Proper token validation before payment processing
- **Data Sanitization**: All user input is properly validated
- **Secure Redirects**: Return URLs are properly encoded and validated
- **Payment Security**: PhonePe integration follows security best practices

## Testing Instructions

### Test Authentication Flow
1. Visit `/register-event` without logging in
2. Fill out the registration form
3. Click "Continue (Login Required)"
4. Verify redirect to login page
5. Log in and verify return to add-ons step with data preserved

### Test Payment Flow
1. Complete registration while logged in
2. Add some add-ons
3. Proceed to payment step
4. Verify PhonePe payment initiation
5. Test payment callback handling

### Test State Preservation
1. Start registration without login
2. Get redirected to login
3. Close browser/tab
4. Return and log in
5. Visit `/register-event?step=payment`
6. Verify all data is restored

## Configuration

Ensure the following environment variables are set for PhonePe:
- `PHONEPE_MERCHANT_ID`
- `PHONEPE_SALT_KEY`
- `PHONEPE_SALT_INDEX`
- `PHONEPE_IS_TEST_MODE`

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. Consider these enhancements:

1. **Email Notifications**: Send confirmation emails after successful registration
2. **SMS Notifications**: Send SMS updates for payment status
3. **Analytics**: Track user flow and conversion rates
4. **A/B Testing**: Test different authentication prompts
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Further optimize for mobile devices
