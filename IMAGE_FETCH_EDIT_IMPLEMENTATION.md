# Image Fetch and Edit Page Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented image fetching functionality for both event and game edit pages. The edit pages now load existing images when opening and allow uploading new images that are sent to the respective webhook APIs.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. New API Endpoints for Image Fetching

#### Event Image Fetch Endpoint
- **Path**: `/api/eventimages/get`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Fetches existing event images from external API
- **External API**: `https://ai.alviongs.com/webhook/nibog/geteventwithimages/get`
- **Payload**: `{"event_id": 99}`
- **Response**: Array of event images with id, event_id, image_url, priority, is_active, timestamps

#### Game Image Fetch Endpoint
- **Path**: `/api/gamesimage/get`
- **Method**: POST
- **Purpose**: Fetches existing game images from external API
- **External API**: `https://ai.alviongs.com/webhook/nibog/gamesimage/get`
- **Payload**: `{"game_id": 25}`
- **Response**: Array of game images with id, game_id, image_url, priority, is_active, timestamps

### 2. Service Functions Added

#### Event Service (`services/eventService.ts`)
- `fetchEventImages(eventId: number)`: Fetches event images by event ID

#### Game Service (`services/babyGameService.ts`)
- `fetchGameImages(gameId: number)`: Fetches game images by game ID

### 3. Event Edit Page Updates (`app/admin/events/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)

#### New State Variables:
- `eventImageFile`: Stores selected file before upload
- `existingImages`: Array of existing images from API
- `isLoadingImages`: Loading state for image fetching

#### New Functionality:
- Fetches existing images when page loads
- Displays existing images with priority and status
- Allows selecting new image files with validation
- Uploads new images after successful event update
- Sends new images to webhook with event ID

#### UI Improvements:
- Shows "Loading existing images..." while fetching
- Displays existing images in a clean list format
- Shows "New image selected" status for pending uploads
- Provides clear feedback for upload success/failure

### 4. Game Edit Page Updates (`app/admin/games/[id]/edit/page.tsx`)

#### New State Variables:
- `gameImageFile`: Stores selected file before upload
- `existingImages`: Array of existing images from API
- `isLoadingImages`: Loading state for image fetching

#### New Functionality:
- Fetches existing images when page loads
- Displays existing images with priority and status
- Allows selecting new image files with validation
- Uploads new images after successful game update
- Sends new images to webhook with game ID

#### UI Improvements:
- Shows "Loading existing images..." while fetching
- Displays existing images in a clean list format
- Shows "New image selected" status for pending uploads
- Provides clear feedback for upload success/failure

### 5. Enhanced User Experience

#### Image Display:
- **Existing Images**: Shows filename, priority, and active status
- **New Images**: Shows selected filename with "will be uploaded" message
- **Loading States**: Clear indicators for fetching and uploading

#### Validation:
- File type validation (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP only)
- File size validation (5MB limit)
- User-friendly error messages

#### Flow:
1. Page loads → Fetches existing images
2. User selects new image → Validates and stores file
3. User updates event/game → Updates successfully
4. If new image selected → Uploads image and sends to webhook
5. Shows appropriate success/error messages

### 6. Error Handling

#### Graceful Degradation:
- If image fetching fails, page continues to work without images
- If image upload fails, event/game update still succeeds
- Clear error messages for all failure scenarios

#### Logging:
- Detailed console logs for debugging
- API response logging
- Error tracking for troubleshooting

## API Response Formats

### Event Images Response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 4,
    "event_id": 131,
    "image_url": "./upload/eventimages/eventimage_1757947801601_4538.png",
    "priority": 1,
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2025-09-15T09:20:04.921Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-09-15T09:20:04.921Z"
  }
]
```

### Game Images Response:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 4,
    "game_id": 131,
    "image_url": "./upload/gameimages/gameimage_1757947801601_4538.png",
    "priority": 1,
    "is_active": true,
    "created_at": "2025-09-15T09:20:04.921Z",

  }
]
```

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `app/api/eventimages/get/route.ts` - Event image fetch API
- `app/api/gamesimage/get/route.ts` - Game image fetch API
- `test-image-fetch-flow.js` - Test script for image fetching

### Modified Files:
- `app/admin/events/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Added image fetching and display
- `app/admin/games/[id]/edit/page.tsx` - Added image fetching and display
- `services/eventService.ts` - Added fetchEventImages function
- `services/babyGameService.ts` - Added fetchGameImages function

## Usage Instructions

### For Event Edit Page:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3111/admin/events/{id}/edit`
2. Page automatically loads existing images (if any)
3. Existing images are displayed with priority and status
4. Select a new image file to upload (optional)
5. Update the event - new image will be uploaded and sent to webhook

### For Game Edit Page:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3111/admin/games/{id}/edit`
2. Page automatically loads existing images (if any)
3. Existing images are displayed with priority and status
4. Select a new image file to upload (optional)
5. Update the game - new image will be uploaded and sent to webhook

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test script (`test-image-fetch-flow.js`)
- Verified both API endpoints work correctly
- Confirmed image fetching works for both events and games
- Tested graceful handling of missing images
- Verified UI updates work correctly

## Integration with Existing Functionality
- Seamlessly integrates with existing edit page functionality
- Maintains all existing form validation and submission logic
- Preserves existing error handling and user feedback
- Compatible with existing image upload and webhook systems

## Security and Validation
- Server-side validation for all API requests
- File type and size validation for uploads
- Proper error handling for external API failures
- Secure handling of file uploads and webhook calls
